# SimpleSimCLR

A simple implementation of the SimCLR framework with a Jupyter Notebook to
demonstrate it. The trained weights of models is in the repo as well (this is
bad! but it's convenient for the demo).

For Vandy Summer 2024 PyTorch workshops.

## Usage

```
python train.py unsupervised
```

For more options:

```
python train.py --help
```
