# SimpleSimCLR

A simple implementation of the SimCLR framework with a Jupyter Notebook to
demonstrate it. The trained weights of models is in the repo as well (this is
bad! but it's convenient for the demo).

For Vandy Summer 2024 PyTorch workshops.

## Usage

The train.py has a command line interface for training.

To train the model with SimCLR:

```
python train.py unsupervised
```

For more options:

```
python train.py --help
```
